Unpack the source, running
 ./setup.py install

The python module uuid is required to enable automatic UUID creation at
the server

Copy the sample configuration into /etc/amebaC3.conf

Copy the apache configuration in a proper location. This is required to
enable the amebaC3 locations for register and update

Create the db root directory, with permissions for apache user. Minimal
required configuration is a database section on main configuration file,
with keyword 'type' for the database backend (fs or bdb)
Initialize the database running
 python -c 'import amebaC3.database ; amebaC3.database.initialize()'


callbacks
---------

Some of the callbacks require specific configuration and setup. To disable
all callbacks, set enable to false in the main configuration file


NAGIOS CALLBACK
===============

Create the nagios directory, with permissions for apache user. Add that
directory to the nagios configuration file with a cfg_dir directive, and
copy amebaC3_templates.cfg into it. Copy also the ameba_freshness_exceeded.sh
script to the plugins directory ($USER1)
If either the chosen directory for nagios configs or the nagios external
commands file are not the standar ones, they must be included in the main
configuration nagios section (keywords cfg_dir and commandfile)

services
--------

Nagios services available for registration must be listed in the services
entry at the nagios configuration section. Each individual service needs
a configuration section to define the template and the command to check,
although a default template can be defined at the nagios section using
the keyword service-template

authentication
--------------

The amebaC3 database can be used also to define users, that can be enabled
for the nagios web location. This requires to enable authentication in
nagios cgi configuration (uncommenting standard entries should be enough)

<Directory /usr/lib/nagios/cgi-bin/>
   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "Ameba C3 Monitoring"
   PythonAuthenHandler amebaC3.login
   Require valid-user
</Directory>

<Directory /usr/share/nagios/html/>
   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "Ameba C3 Monitoring"
   PythonAuthenHandler amebaC3.login
   Require valid-user
</Directory>


COBBLER CALLBACK
================

The cobbler callback requires valid credentials and xmlrpc url on the
main configuration file
