Modes : register , pull , pulldaemon

* register
Register teh system in the amebaC3 server, supplying all the required
information (hostname, distro).
The url for amebaC3 server and the uuid are mandatory, and can be given on
command line or taken from an already existing configuration file. The distro
name or primary channel are guessed, although can be specified using the
option --distro. A random uuid can be created using option --autogenerate.
After successful registration, values supplied on command line are stored
on config file.

* pull
* pulldaemon
Perform the system upgrade against the configured source repositories,
reporting to amebaC3 server. While pulldaemon starts in daemon mode, pull
performs a single operation and exits. There are some options common to
both operation modes to set upgrade and check modes, and to specify a random
wait time before start the actual operation. When taken from configuration
file, options in pull section are also accounted in the pulldaemon operation
mode. The pulldaemon mode accepts an additional --check-interval option to
specify the interval among runs, and option --store will rewrite configuration
file values with those specified in command line.
